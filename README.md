## ðŸ§¾ Overview

Estimating the correct resale value of a vehicle can be difficult due to numerous factors such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. This project leverages machine learning to build a regression model that can predict vehicle prices based on historical data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Example Dataset â€“ Kaggle or Custom]
- **Size**: ~30,000 records of used cars
- **Features**:
  - `Make`
  - `Model`
  - `Year`
  - `Engine Size`
  - `Fuel Type`
  - `Transmission`
  - `Mileage`
  - `Price` (Target)

## ðŸ§  Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Calculate vehicle age
   - Normalize/scale numeric features

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting (Optional)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - RÂ² Score

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

| Model                | MAE     | RMSE    | RÂ² Score |
|---------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Linear Regression    | 2700.4  | 4100.6  | 0.78     |
| Random Forest        | 1900.2  | 3005.9  | 0.89     |
| Gradient Boosting    | 1850.7  | 2900.3  | 0.91     |

> Random Forest and Gradient Boosting yielded the best performance with low error and high accuracy.
